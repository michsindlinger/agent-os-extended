# Transfer and Create Bug Report Rules

## Overview

Transfer a brainstorming session about a bug into a formal bug report, validating completeness and filling gaps through interactive questionnaire.

<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/instructions/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

<process_flow>

<step number="1" subagent="context-fetcher" name="session_retrieval">

### Step 1: Retrieve Bug Brainstorming Session

Use the context-fetcher subagent to find and analyze the relevant bug-related brainstorming session.

<session_discovery>
  SCAN .agent-os/brainstorming/ for sessions
  FILTER by:
    - status: ready-for-bug OR active
    - type: bug OR general (with bug content)
  
  IF multiple_sessions_found:
    PRESENT numbered list with bug indicators
    WAIT for user selection
  ELSE IF single_session_found:
    CONFIRM: "Transfer bug session '[SESSION_ID]' to bug report?"
  ELSE IF no_sessions_found:
    INFORM: "No bug-related brainstorming sessions found"
    SUGGEST: "Use 'start-brainstorming' first"
    EXIT process
</session_discovery>

<session_analysis>
  READ selected session.md file
  EXTRACT bug-related content:
    - Problem description
    - Symptoms observed
    - Impact discussion
    - Reproduction attempts
    - Workarounds mentioned
    - Root cause theories
    - Solution ideas
  
  ASSESS completeness for bug report
</session_analysis>

</step>

<step number="2" name="bug_report_validation">

### Step 2: Validate Bug Information Completeness

Analyze brainstorming content against bug report requirements to identify gaps.

<required_elements>
  <bug_identification>
    - [ ] Clear bug title
    - [ ] Problem summary
    - [ ] First occurrence date/version
    - [ ] Frequency of occurrence
  </bug_identification>
  
  <reproduction_details>
    - [ ] Steps to reproduce
    - [ ] Expected behavior
    - [ ] Actual behavior
    - [ ] Error messages/logs
  </reproduction_details>
  
  <environment_info>
    - [ ] System/browser/device
    - [ ] Software version
    - [ ] User role/permissions
    - [ ] Related configurations
  </environment_info>
  
  <impact_assessment>
    - [ ] Users affected
    - [ ] Severity level
    - [ ] Business impact
    - [ ] Workaround availability
  </impact_assessment>
  
  <investigation_details>
    - [ ] Initial investigation done
    - [ ] Root cause hypotheses
    - [ ] Related issues/bugs
    - [ ] Solution proposals
  </investigation_details>
</required_elements>

<gap_analysis>
  FOR each required_element:
    IF found_in_brainstorming:
      MARK as complete
      EXTRACT relevant content
    ELSE:
      ADD to missing_information list
      PREPARE specific questions
</gap_analysis>

</step>

<step number="3" name="interactive_questionnaire">

### Step 3: Interactive Bug Details Collection

If gaps identified, conduct targeted questionnaire to gather missing bug information.

<questionnaire_intro>
  "I've analyzed your bug discussion about '[TOPIC]'.
  To create a complete bug report, I need some additional details:"
</questionnaire_intro>

<question_categories>
  <reproduction_questions>
    IF steps_to_reproduce_missing:
      ASK: "Can you provide exact steps to reproduce this bug?"
      ASK: "Does this happen every time or intermittently?"
      ASK: "What were you doing when you first encountered this?"
  </reproduction_questions>
  
  <behavior_questions>
    IF expected_vs_actual_unclear:
      ASK: "What should happen normally?"
      ASK: "What actually happens instead?"
      ASK: "Are there any error messages or unusual outputs?"
  </behavior_questions>
  
  <environment_questions>
    IF environment_unknown:
      ASK: "What browser/device/system are you using?"
      ASK: "What version of the software?"
      ASK: "Are there specific configurations or settings?"
  </environment_questions>
  
  <impact_questions>
    IF severity_undefined:
      ASK: "How many users are affected?"
      ASK: "Can users continue working despite this bug?"
      ASK: "What's the business impact?"
      ASK: "Is there a workaround available?"
  </impact_questions>
  
  <investigation_questions>
    IF root_cause_unclear:
      ASK: "Have you noticed any patterns?"
      ASK: "When did this start happening?"
      ASK: "Were there recent changes to the system?"
  </investigation_questions>
</question_categories>

<response_handling>
  FOR each question:
    PRESENT question contextually
    WAIT for user response
    IF response_needs_clarification:
      ASK specific follow-up
    CAPTURE detailed response
    UPDATE bug information model
</response_handling>

</step>

<step number="4" name="bug_information_preparation">

### Step 4: Prepare Information for Bug Report Generation

Prepare all gathered information in the format expected by create-bug command.

<information_preparation>
  <compile_bug_data>
    STRUCTURE information as:
      - bug_title: [FROM_BRAINSTORMING_TOPIC]
      - description: [FROM_DISCUSSION_AND_QUESTIONNAIRE]
      - reproduction_steps: [EXTRACTED_OR_GATHERED]
      - expected_behavior: [FROM_QUESTIONNAIRE]
      - actual_behavior: [FROM_DISCUSSION]
      - environment: [FROM_QUESTIONNAIRE]
      - severity: [ASSESSED_FROM_IMPACT]
      - workaround: [IF_DISCUSSED]
  </compile_bug_data>
  
  <add_transfer_metadata>
    - source: "brainstorming_transfer"
    - session_id: [SESSION_ID]
    - session_path: ".agent-os/brainstorming/[SESSION_ID]/session.md"
    - transfer_date: [CURRENT_DATE]
    - gaps_filled: [LIST_OF_QUESTIONNAIRE_ITEMS]
    - investigation_notes: [FROM_BRAINSTORMING]
  </add_transfer_metadata>
</information_preparation>

</step>

<step number="5" name="execute_create_bug">

### Step 5: Execute Create-Bug Command

Use the existing create-bug command with the prepared information.

<command_execution>
  EXECUTE: @.agent-os/instructions/core/create-bug.md
  
  WITH context:
    - Pre-filled bug details from brainstorming
    - Questionnaire responses for gaps
    - Skip redundant questions
    - Include transfer attribution
  
  MODIFICATIONS:
    - Add "Source" section with brainstorming reference
    - Include investigation theories from session
    - Preserve solution ideas discussed
</command_execution>

<bug_report_customization>
  ENSURE bug report includes:
    ## Source
    > Transferred from Brainstorming Session: [SESSION_ID]
    > Original Discussion: @.agent-os/brainstorming/[SESSION_ID]/session.md
    > Transfer Date: [CURRENT_DATE]
    
    ## Additional Context from Brainstorming
    - Initial theories explored
    - Workarounds discovered
    - Solution ideas proposed
    - Questions resolved during transfer
</bug_report_customization>

</step>

<step number="7" subagent="file-creator" name="session_update">

### Step 7: Update Brainstorming Session

Use the file-creator subagent to update the original brainstorming session with transfer status.

<session_update>
  APPEND to original session.md:
  
  ---
  
  ## Transfer Complete
  
  **Transferred to Bug Report:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
  **Bug ID:** [BUG_ID]
  **Bug Report:** @.agent-os/bugs/[BUG_FOLDER]/bug-report.md
  **Additional Information Gathered:** [YES/NO]
  **Status:** Transferred
  
  ### Information Added During Transfer
  - Reproduction steps: [REFINED/ADDED]
  - Environment details: [SPECIFIED]
  - Impact assessment: [COMPLETED]
  - [OTHER_ADDITIONS]
  
  ### Transfer Notes
  [ANY_IMPORTANT_NOTES]
</session_update>

</step>

<step number="8" name="user_confirmation">

### Step 8: Present Transfer Results

Provide comprehensive summary of the bug report creation.

<transfer_summary>
  ## Bug Report Successfully Created from Brainstorming
  
  **Bug ID:** [BUG_ID]
  **Original Session:** [SESSION_ID] - [TOPIC]
  **Severity:** [SEVERITY_LEVEL]
  
  ### Information Transfer Status
  ✅ Transferred from brainstorming: [X] items
  ✅ Gathered via questionnaire: [Y] items  
  ✅ Structured for investigation: [Z] aspects
  
  ### Created Structure
  - Bug Report: @.agent-os/bugs/[BUG_FOLDER]/bug-report.md
  - Investigation: @.agent-os/bugs/[BUG_FOLDER]/investigation/
  - Resolution: @.agent-os/bugs/[BUG_FOLDER]/resolution/
  
  ### Key Information Captured
  - **Reproduction:** [STEPS_STATUS]
  - **Environment:** [DETAILS_STATUS]
  - **Impact:** [ASSESSMENT_STATUS]
  - **Investigation:** [NOTES_STATUS]
  
  ### Next Steps
  1. Review the bug report for accuracy
  2. Add any screenshots or logs if available
  3. Begin investigation using provided structure
