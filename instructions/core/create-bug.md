# Create Bug Report - Core Instructions

## Overview
Create a structured bug report that enables systematic investigation and resolution. This command initiates an interactive process to gather all necessary information for effective bug tracking.

## Process Flow

### 1. Initial Information Gathering
Start by asking the user for:
- **Bug Title**: Short, descriptive title
- **Bug Description**: Detailed description of the issue
- **Severity Level**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Priority**: Urgent, High, Normal, Low

### 2. Interactive Investigation Questions
Ask targeted questions to understand the bug context:

#### Environment & Context
- What environment does this occur in? (development, staging, production)
- What browser/platform/OS are you using?
- When did you first notice this issue?
- Does this happen consistently or intermittently?

#### Reproduction Steps
- What steps lead to this issue?
- What were you trying to accomplish?
- Can you reproduce it reliably?
- Are there any specific conditions needed?

#### Expected vs Actual Behavior
- What did you expect to happen?
- What actually happened instead?
- Are there any error messages or logs?

#### Impact Assessment
- Who is affected by this bug?
- What functionality is broken?
- Are there any workarounds available?

#### Technical Context
- Which components/modules might be involved?
- Are there any recent changes that could be related?
- Have you seen similar issues before?

### 3. Bug File Creation
Create a structured bug file in `.agent-os/bugs/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-title/` with:

#### Structure:
```
.agent-os/bugs/YYYY-MM-DD-bug-title/
├── bug-report.md          # Main bug documentation
├── investigation/         # Investigation notes and findings
├── reproduction/          # Steps and test cases for reproduction
└── resolution/           # Solution documentation (created during execution)
```

#### bug-report.md Template:
```markdown
# [Bug Title]

*Bug ID: [Generated unique ID]*
*Created with Agent OS Bug Management System*
```

### 4. Validation and Confirmation
Before creating the bug file:
- Review all gathered information with the user
- Confirm the severity and priority levels
- Ensure reproduction steps are clear
- Verify the bug title is descriptive

### 5. File System Organization
- Create the bug directory with timestamp format: `YYYY-MM-DD-bug-title`
- Generate a unique bug ID for tracking
- Create all necessary subdirectories
- Initialize the bug-report.md file

## Output
Confirm creation with:
- Bug directory path
- Bug ID for future reference
- Summary of key information
- Next steps (suggest using `execute-bug` command)

## Integration Notes
- Bug files are structured to integrate with `update-changelog` command
- Status tracking enables systematic workflow management
- Investigation directory supports collaborative debugging
- Resolution documentation enables knowledge sharing

## Error Handling
If insufficient information is provided:
- Ask clarifying questions
- Provide examples of good bug descriptions
- Guide user through the process step by step
- Don't create incomplete bug reports
