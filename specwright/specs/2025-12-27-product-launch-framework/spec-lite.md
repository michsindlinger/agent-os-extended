# Product Launch Framework - Phase A: Market Validation System

> Quick Reference | Created: 2025-12-27
> Full Spec: @specwright/specs/2025-12-27-product-launch-framework/spec.md

## What Is This?

A data-driven market validation system that helps you validate product demand **before** expensive development. Run competitive analysis, create landing pages, execute ad campaigns, and get GO/NO-GO recommendations based on real market data.

## The Problem

Building products without market validation wastes time and money. You need to know if people actually want your product before investing months in development.

## The Solution

`/validate-market` command that coordinates 5 specialist agents to:
1. **Research competitors** (market-researcher using Perplexity MCP)
2. **Create landing page** (validation-specialist generates HTML/CSS/JS)
3. **Plan ad campaigns** (Google Ads, Meta Ads with targeting specs)
4. **Setup analytics** (GA4, conversion tracking, heatmaps)
5. **Analyze results** (business-analyst provides GO/NO-GO decision)

## Key Features

### 1. Competitive Intelligence
- Find 5-10 competitors automatically
- Feature comparison matrix
- Market gap identification
- Positioning recommendations

### 2. Landing Page Generation
- Production-ready HTML/CSS/JS (single file)
- Responsive design
- SEO-optimized
- Email collection form
- Deploy to Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages

### 3. Ad Campaign Planning
- 5-10 ad copy variants per platform
- Targeting specifications
- Budget recommendations (€100-€2000+)
- Step-by-step setup guides

### 4. GO/NO-GO Decision
- **Conversion Rate**: >5% = GO, 3-5% = MAYBE, <3% = NO-GO
- **Cost Per Acquisition**: <€10 = GO, €10-20 = MAYBE, >€20 = NO-GO
- **Market Size**: >100k TAM = GO, 50k-100k = MAYBE, <50k = NO-GO

- ❌ Automatic ad campaign execution (planning only)
- ❌ A/B testing automation
- ❌ Email service provider integration
- ❌ Team collaboration features (/build-team)
- ❌ Scrum/Agile events (/write-user-stories, /plan-sprint)

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Landing page is production-ready (no edits needed)
- ✅ Competitor analysis identifies 5-10 competitors
- ✅ Ad campaigns include 5-10 variants with targeting
- ✅ GO/NO-GO decision is clear and data-driven

## Estimated Effort

**Implementation**: 26-32 hours total
- Skills: 6-7h (6 skills)
- Templates: 2.5-3.5h (7 templates)
- Agents: 6-7h (7 agents: +web-developer)
- Workflow: 6-8h (13-14 steps)
- Config + Setup: 2h
- Documentation: 2-3h
- Testing: 2h

## Quick Start (After Implementation)

```bash
# 1. Run market validation
/validate-market "Your product idea description"

# 2. Review outputs
specwright/market-validation/YYYY-MM-DD-product-name/
  ├── competitor-analysis.md
  ├── market-positioning.md
  ├── landing-page/index.html
  ├── ad-campaigns.md
  ├── analytics-setup.md
  └── validation-plan.md

# 3. Deploy landing page (example: Netlify)
cd landing-page
netlify deploy --prod

# 4. Run ad campaigns (2-4 weeks)
# Follow instructions in ad-campaigns.md

# 5. Analyze results
# Provide metrics to business-analyst
# Receive GO/NO-GO recommendation in validation-results.md

# 6. If GO, proceed with planning
/plan-product
# Validation results automatically loaded
```

## Why This Matters

**Without validation**:
- 6 months development
- €50,000 investment
- Launch to crickets
- Product failure

**With validation**:
- 2-4 weeks testing
- €500-2,000 ad spend
- Clear GO/NO-GO signal
- If GO: Build with confidence
- If NO-GO: Save 6 months and €50,000

**ROI**: Avoid building products nobody wants. Validate demand before development.
