# Spec Summary (Lite)

Migrate Specwright to Version 2.0 architecture in two phases: Phase I implements structural changes (directory renaming, command isolation, migration scripts) for alignment with v2.0 conventions while maintaining project-level installation. Phase II adds advanced features including profile system (Java Spring Boot, React, Angular), Claude Skills-based standards injection, enhanced research workflows with codebase analysis, and verification systems for quality gates.
