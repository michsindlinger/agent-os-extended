# Task Execution Rules (Phase-Based Architecture)

## Overview

Execute tasks using a **phase-based architecture** optimized for token efficiency.
Each phase is a discrete unit that ends with a pause point for `/clear`.

<architecture>
  <principle>Each phase = One focused task + State persistence + Pause</principle>
  <benefit>Minimal token usage per phase</benefit>
  <benefit>Perfect resumability via Kanban Board</benefit>
  <benefit>No context overflow</benefit>
</architecture>

<pre_flight_check>
  EXECUTE: @~/.agent-os/workflows/meta/pre-flight.md
</pre_flight_check>

---

## Phase Detection (Entry Point)

<phase_detection>
  WHEN /execute-tasks is invoked:

  1. CHECK: Does kanban-board.md exist for any spec?
     ```bash
     ls agent-os/specs/*/kanban-board.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
     ```

  2. IF kanban-board.md EXISTS:
     READ: Resume Context section
     EXTRACT: Current Phase field
     GOTO: Appropriate phase based on state

  3. IF NO kanban-board.md:
     GOTO: Phase 1 (Initialize)

  <phase_routing>
    | Resume Context State | Next Phase |
    |---------------------|------------|
    | No kanban board | Phase 1: Initialize |
    | Phase: 1-complete | Phase 2: Git Worktree |
    | Phase: 2-complete | Phase 3: Execute Story |
    | Phase: story-complete | Phase 3: Execute Story (next) |
    | Phase: all-stories-done | Phase 4.5: Integration Validation |
    | Phase: 5-ready | Phase 5: Finalize |
  </phase_routing>
</phase_detection>

---

## Phase 1: Initialize (Spec Selection + Kanban Board)

<phase number="1" name="initialize">

### Purpose
Select specification and create Kanban Board. This is a one-time setup phase.

### Entry Condition
- No kanban-board.md exists for target spec

### Actions

<step name="spec_selection">
  CHECK: Did user provide spec name as parameter?

  IF parameter provided:
    VALIDATE: agent-os/specs/[spec-name]/ exists
    SET: SELECTED_SPEC = [spec-name]

  ELSE:
    LIST: Available specs
    ```bash
    ls -1 agent-os/specs/ | sort -r
    ```

    IF 1 spec: CONFIRM with user
    IF multiple: ASK user via AskUserQuestion
</step>

<step name="create_kanban_board" subagent="file-creator">
  USE: file-creator subagent

  PROMPT: "Create kanban board for spec: agent-os/specs/{SELECTED_SPEC}/

  Source: Parse story files in stories/ directory (NOT user-stories.md)
  Output: agent-os/specs/{SELECTED_SPEC}/kanban-board.md
  Template: agent-os/templates/docs/kanban-board-template.md (global) or agent-os/templates/docs/kanban-board-template.md (project)

  CRITICAL STEPS:
  1. LIST all story files in agent-os/specs/{SELECTED_SPEC}/stories/
  2. FOR EACH story file:
     - READ the story file
     - VALIDATE DoR for each story:
       * CHECK: All DoR checkboxes are marked [x] (checked)
       * IF any DoR checkbox is [ ] (unchecked):
         - STORY_STATUS: BLOCKED - Incomplete DoR
         - ADD_NOTE: 'Missing DoR items. Please run /create-spec again to complete technical refinement.'
       * IF all DoR checkboxes are [x]:
         - STORY_STATUS: Ready
     - EXTRACT: Story ID, Title, Type, Dependencies, Points

  3. PARSE story details into table format
  4. CREATE kanban board with:
     - All valid stories in Backlog
     - Blocked stories marked with status

  CRITICAL: Use the template structure EXACTLY as defined. The template contains:
  - Resume Context section (CRITICAL for phase recovery)
  - Board Status metrics (with exact field names for parsing)
  - Backlog, In Progress, In Review, Testing, Done sections
  - Change Log section

  Template Variables to Replace:
  - {{SPEC_NAME}} → Spec folder name
  - {{SPEC_FOLDER}} → Spec folder name (same)
  - {{TOTAL_STORIES}} → Count from story files
  - {{COMPLETED_COUNT}} → 0
  - {{IN_PROGRESS_COUNT}} → 0
  - {{IN_REVIEW_COUNT}} → 0
  - {{TESTING_COUNT}} → 0
  - {{BACKLOG_COUNT}} → Count of READY stories (excluding blocked)
  - {{BLOCKED_COUNT}} → Count of BLOCKED stories (incomplete DoR)
  - {{CURRENT_PHASE}} → 1-complete
  - {{NEXT_PHASE}} → 2 - Git Worktree
  - {{WORKTREE_PATH}} → Pending (set in Phase 2)
  - {{GIT_BRANCH}} → Pending (set in Phase 2)
  - {{CURRENT_STORY}} → None
  - {{LAST_ACTION}} → Kanban board created
  - {{NEXT_ACTION}} → Create git worktree for parallel execution
  - {{BACKLOG_STORIES}} → All READY stories from story files in table format
  - {{BLOCKED_STORIES}} → Section for stories with incomplete DoR
  - {{IN_PROGRESS_STORIES}} → (empty section with comment)
  - {{IN_REVIEW_STORIES}} → (empty section with comment)
  - {{TESTING_STORIES}} → (empty section with comment)
  - {{DONE_STORIES}} → (empty section with comment)
  - {{CHANGE_LOG_ENTRIES}} → Initial entry: Board created with DoR validation

  Story Table Format (use for each story section):
  | Story ID | Title | Type | Dependencies | DoR Status | Points |
  |----------|-------|------|--------------|------------|--------|
  | STORY-ID | Story Title | Backend/Frontend/DevOps/Test | None or STORY-ID, STORY-ID | ✅ Ready or ⚠️ Blocked | 1/2/3/5/8 |

  IMPORTANT: The Board Status section MUST be parseable by shell scripts:
  - Use exact field names: Total Stories, Completed, In Progress, In Review, Testing, Backlog
  - Format: **Fieldname**: number

  DoR VALIDATION RULES:
  - Story must have '### Technisches Refinement (vom Architect)' section
  - Under '#### DoR (Definition of Ready)':
    - 'Fachliche Anforderungen' subsection must have all [x] checked
    - 'Technische Vorbereitung' subsection must have all [x] checked
  - If any [ ] (unchecked) found: Mark as BLOCKED with note which items are missing

  OUTPUT VALIDATION:
  - Count total stories from story files
  - Count stories with complete DoR (ready for execution)
  - Count stories with incomplete DoR (blocked)
  - Report summary to user after creation

  IF BLOCKED stories found:
    ADD_WARNING: '⚠️ Some stories are BLOCKED due to incomplete Definition of Ready.
                   Please run /create-spec again to complete technical refinement.
                   Blocked stories: [list of story IDs]'"

  WAIT: For file-creator completion

  VALIDATE: DoR validation was performed
  CHECK: If any stories were marked as BLOCKED
  IF blocked_stories > 0:
    DISPLAY: Warning about blocked stories
    LIST: Each blocked story with missing DoR items
    OFFER: 'Run /create-spec again to complete technical refinement?'
</step>

### Phase Completion

<phase_complete>
  UPDATE: kanban-board.md Resume Context
    - Current Phase: 1-complete
    - Next Phase: 2 - Git Worktree

  OUTPUT to user:
  ---
  ## ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Initialization

  **Created:**
  - Kanban Board: agent-os/specs/{SELECTED_SPEC}/kanban-board.md
  - Stories loaded: [X] stories in Backlog

  **Next Phase:** Git Worktree Setup (for parallel execution)

  ---
  **👉 To continue, run:**
  ```
  /clear
  /execute-tasks
  ```
  ---

  STOP: Do not proceed to Phase 2
</phase_complete>

</phase>

---

## Phase 2: Git Branch Setup

<phase number="2" name="git_branch">

### Purpose
Create or switch to the appropriate git branch for this spec.

### Entry Condition
- kanban-board.md exists
- Resume Context shows: Phase 1-complete or Next Phase = 2

### Actions

<step name="load_resume_context">
  READ: agent-os/specs/{SELECTED_SPEC}/kanban-board.md
  EXTRACT: Resume Context section
  VALIDATE: Phase 1 is complete
</step>

<step name="check_dev_server">
  RUN: lsof -i :3000 2>/dev/null | head -5

  IF server running:
    ASK: "Dev server running on port 3000. Shut down? (yes/no)"
    IF yes: Kill server
</step>

<step name="git_worktree_creation" subagent="git-workflow">
  USE: git-workflow subagent

  PROMPT: "Create git worktree for parallel spec execution: {SELECTED_SPEC}

  **CRITICAL: Use Git Worktree for Parallel Execution**

  This enables multiple specs to execute simultaneously without branch conflicts.

  Rules:
  1. Extract worktree name from spec folder (remove YYYY-MM-DD- prefix)
     - Example: 2026-01-13-multi-delete-projects → multi-delete-projects
     - Example: 2026-01-12-bugfix-login-error → bugfix-login-error

  2. Extract branch name (same as worktree name)
     - If 'bugfix' in worktree name: use 'bugfix/' prefix for branch
     - Example: bugfix-login-error → branch: bugfix/login-error

  3. Create git worktree:
     ```bash
     # Base directory for worktrees
     WORKTREE_BASE='agent-os/worktrees'

     # Create worktree directory
     mkdir -p '$WORKTREE_BASE'

     # Create worktree with new branch
     git worktree add '$WORKTREE_BASE/$WORKTREE_NAME' -b '$BRANCH_NAME'
     ```

  4. Verify worktree was created:
     ```bash
     git worktree list
     ```

  5. Return these values for Resume Context:
     - WORKTREE_PATH: agent-os/worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME
     - GIT_BRANCH: $BRANCH_NAME

  **Handle Edge Cases:**
  - If worktree already exists: Verify it matches the spec, use it
  - If branch already exists: Create worktree with existing branch
  - If uncommitted changes in main repo: Commit or stash first

  **Examples:**
  - Spec: 2026-01-13-multi-delete-projects
    → Worktree: agent-os/worktrees/multi-delete-projects
    → Branch: multi-delete-projects

  - Spec: 2026-01-12-bugfix-login-error
    → Worktree: agent-os/worktrees/bugfix-login-error
    → Branch: bugfix/login-error

  - Spec: 2026-01-14-user-authentication
    → Worktree: agent-os/worktrees/user-authentication
    → Branch: user-authentication
  "

  WAIT: For git-workflow completion

  CAPTURE: WORKTREE_PATH and GIT_BRANCH values for Resume Context

## Resume Context Structure

<resume_context_schema>
  The Resume Context in kanban-board.md follows the template structure.

  **Template Location**:
  - Global: ~/.agent-os/templates/docs/kanban-board-template.md
  - Project: agent-os/templates/docs/kanban-board-template.md

  The Resume Context MUST contain:

  | Field | Description | Example Values |
  |-------|-------------|----------------|
  | **Current Phase** | Phase identifier | 1-complete, 2-complete, story-complete, all-stories-done, 5-ready, complete |
  | **Next Phase** | What to execute next | 2 - Git Worktree, 3 - Execute Story, 4.5 - Integration Validation, 5 - Finalize, None |
  | **Spec Folder** | Full path | agent-os/specs/2026-01-13-multi-delete-projects |
  | **Worktree Path** | Path to git worktree for parallel execution | agent-os/worktrees/multi-delete-projects or Pending |
  | **Git Branch** | Branch name for this spec | multi-delete-projects or Pending |
  | **Current Story** | Story being worked on | MDP-001 or None |
  | **Last Action** | What just happened | Kanban board created |
  | **Next Action** | What needs to happen | Create git worktree |

  **Board Status Metrics** (for shell script parsing):
  | Field | Parse Pattern | Example |
  |-------|---------------|---------|
  | **Total Stories** | `Total Stories.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 4 |
  | **Completed** | `Completed.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 2 |
  | **In Progress** | `In Progress.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 0 |
  | **In Review** | `In Review.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 0 |
  | **Testing** | `Testing.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 0 |
  | **Backlog** | `Backlog.*\*\*.*([0-9]+)` | 2 |

  <update_rules>
    UPDATE kanban-board.md at:
    - End of each phase (Resume Context + Change Log)
    - Before any STOP point
    - After any state change (story movement, status change)

    CRITICAL: Always maintain the template structure exactly.
  </update_rules>
</resume_context_schema>

## Error Handling

<error_protocols>
  <blocking_issues>
    UPDATE: kanban-board.md → Story status = Blocked
    UPDATE: Resume Context → Last Action = "Blocked: [reason]"
    NOTIFY: User
    STOP: Phase (user can resume after resolving)
  </blocking_issues>

  <agent_failures>
    RETRY: Up to 2 times
    IF still failing:
      UPDATE: Resume Context → Last Action = "Agent failed: [details]"
      ESCALATE: To user
      STOP: Phase
  </agent_failures>
</error_protocols>

## Token Optimization Notes

<token_optimization>
  <why_phases>
    - Each phase starts fresh with minimal context
    - Only Resume Context needed to continue
    - No accumulated conversation history
    - Kanban Board is single source of truth
  </why_phases>

  <expected_savings>
    - Old approach: 50K-100K+ tokens per full execution
    - New approach: ~10-20K tokens per phase
    - Result: 3-5x token reduction
  </expected_savings>

  <user_flow>
    1. /execute-tasks → Phase 1 runs → "Run /clear, then /execute-tasks"
    2. /clear
    3. /execute-tasks → Phase 2 (Git Worktree) runs → "Run /clear, then /execute-tasks"
    4. /clear
    5. /execute-tasks → Phase 3 (Story 1) runs → "Run /clear, then /execute-tasks"
    6. /clear
    7. ... repeat for each story ...
    8. /execute-tasks → Phase 4 runs → "Complete!"
  </user_flow>
</token_optimization>

## Quick Reference

<quick_reference>
  | Phase | Purpose | Subagents Used |
  |-------|---------|----------------|
  | 1 | Initialize | file-creator |
  | 2 | Git Worktree (parallel execution) | git-workflow |
  | 3 | Execute Story | dev-team__*, architect, ux-designer, qa-specialist, git-workflow |
  | 4.5 | Integration Validation | test-runner |
  | 5 | Finalize (PR Creation) | git-workflow |

  <resume_command>
    After /clear, simply run /execute-tasks again.
    Phase detection automatically routes to correct phase.
